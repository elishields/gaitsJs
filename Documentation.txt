---- APP ----

Visualizes economic data onto a world map.
User's request data from pre-listed filters.
Calls custom data from public data source API's.
Arranges the data to be projected onto the map in view.
Calculates standard statistics for each dataset to inform relative representation.
Built in ReactJS for web. To be built for iPhone next.

---- DIRECTORY LAYOUT ----

Each app panel should have its sub-components nested within a sub-directory.

---- COMPONENTS ----

App     // entry point for app
    Map     // parent for map panel
        MapData     // parent for map's data representing
            MapCallData     // call's and passes map data
                MapWorkData     // assesses data
                    MapSetData      // set's data onto map
        MapMenu     // parent for map's menu which controls data filtering

---- SYNTAX ----

'let' is used to set variables local
'var' is used to set variables global

This is a fat arrow function
It is parameterless
It is a cleaner function syntax:
    functionName = () => {

    }

Curly braces {} around code tell the browser to handle the code as JSX
Javascript within a return method/function (which one?) should have this

In React, JS's 'this' syntax is used differently than in traditional JS
Functions are bound to their local component using 'this'
This is done so that function callbacks can be implemented, I think?
Mostly it just makes it clear that anything with 'this' in front of it
Is property of the component class and not the object it was called within
    this.function = this.function.bind(this);

---- EXTERNAL DATA ----

Data is called from source API using XMLHttpRequest()
Data arrives as JSON string
Data is parsed
Data is accessed by specifying location of target data within array

---- INTERNAL DATA ----

Data is passed from a parent component to its child via props
Props are passed in within the parent's return() function
Props are received when the child component is loaded
I believe that props should be set as state
Before being handled by the child component
Either way, I haven't done this
As see in <MapWorkData /> where props are handled directly

---- VISUALIZATION ----

A data plotting framework will need to be found
So that an array of data can be read in a way that matches
Coordinates in array with coordinates on map
And quantities represented on a visualized scale

---- BOOTSTRAP ----

Bootstrap's grid layout is used to arrange HTML elements
This app is being prototyped as a web technology
Because that's all I know how to do
But its future is as a mobile app and desktop tool
This is why grid sizing will be specified for mobile (xs)
And tablet or larger screens (md)
    container-fluid
        row
            col-xs-12
Bootstrap's components will eventually be implemented
