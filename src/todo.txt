datatype problem: double in array index where keyvalue resides is read as NaN when props are received

can props be handled directly?
or must they be set as state?

App updates continuously, even when new data hasn't been called.
This is likely caused by <MapWorkData /> or <MapSetData />.
Could be the componentDidMount or componentDidUpdate event handlers.
But I'm pretty sure I took out the parentheses from the workData function call
    and the app continued to update repeatedly.
