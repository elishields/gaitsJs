---- EXTERNAL DATA ----

Dataset's will have different naming and structure.
Accessing JSON array will need to be customized for each dataset.

---- INTERNAL DATA ----

datatype problem: double in array index where keyvalue resides is read as NaN when props are received

App updates continuously, even when new data hasn't been called.
This is likely caused by <MapWorkData /> or <MapSetData />.
Could be the componentDidMount or componentDidUpdate event handlers.
But I'm pretty sure I took out the parentheses from the workData function call
    and the app continued to update repeatedly.

can props be handled directly?
or must they be set as state?
